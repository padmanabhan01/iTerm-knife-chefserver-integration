# iTerm-knife-chefserver-integration
Fetches the nodes organized by roles and creates a convenient profile shortcut in iTerm

Will ask you for a chef server name and a login name. Will create a JSON file that you can drop into ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/

Then iTerm will display the convenient profile shortcuts

To run it, run from the folder where you knife and just run "ruby knife_iterm_integration.rb"
